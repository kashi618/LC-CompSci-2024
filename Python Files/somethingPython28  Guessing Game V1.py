You're nothing more but a little sheeplet who
follows the herd because he was never taught to
think for himself in his life. What have you done
for humanity, besides mindlessly following other
peopes thoughts? Tell me?´ Exactly. You can't stand
up for yourself because your pathetic self hasn't
achieved anything in life, instead, you walk on twitch
to express your uninteresting opinion in other peoples
chats and you can't stand it when someone talks back to
you. If you want to duke it out IRL, come by and I'll show
you what it means to be a man, you fucking internet warrior.
You can't do anything besides fight behind your screen and
aggressively mash on your keyboard to express yourself. You
have less spine than a fucking worm. Literally the lowest
form of gutter trash society could possibly need. Now
you're here, making threads to witchhunt on someone who
told you the truth you can't handle, which, by the way, is
against the rules of reddit. You should read up to it,
maybe.´ "OH no he blocked me on twitter" Yes, I block 15
year old little fuckwads who think they know how life works.
You are, infact, one of them. Seth Killian can take his
fucking game and shove it up his own fucking ass. You pathetic
plebs are sucking up to someone for no fucking reason and
you're unable to judge by yourself, because you have the
sheep FGC mentality. No dignity here. Have a nice day, enjoy
your imaginary FGC and your shitty little game. In the
meanwhile, I'll play games
and hang around people who have an IQ above 30.""")
