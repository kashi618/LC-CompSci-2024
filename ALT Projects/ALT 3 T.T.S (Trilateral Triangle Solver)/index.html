      <h2>Our Ideas</h2>
      <p>After much debating and tribulation, our group eventually settled upon 4 Ideas for our Modelling and Simulation
        Alt. Following this, we compiled and logged the advantages and disadvantages of each idea. We then compared the
        advantages and disadvantages to find the best idea for us to actually begin work on. </p>

      <h3 style="color:yellow"><u>1st Idea: Model which solves complex mathematical problems</u> - Neil Jiang</h3>
      <h4>Trigonometry:</h4>
      <p>Pythagoras formula (c^2 = a^2 + b^2) <br>SAS, SSS, ASA <br>Sin, Cos, Tan, (invSin, invCos, invTan)</p>
      <h4 style="color:#00ff00">Advantages:</h4>
      <p>-Would be helpful to those new to Trigonometry.
        <br>-Helps save time figuring out triangles<p>
      <h4 style="color:red">Disadvantages:</h4>
      <p>-Does not explain how it came to its conclusions, thus not teaching much to those new to Trigonometry.
        <br>-Newer or younger students may have trouble with inputting correct values of sides and angles as they do not
        fully grasp the concept of Trigonometry yet. This may have the unfortunate byproduct of confusing students
        further.</p>
      
      <h3 style="color:yellow"><u>2nd Idea: Model to assist students in deciding what subjects to study and for how
          long</u> - Gabriel.C</h3>
      <p>Determines if a student should study a subject based on how well they are doing and compared to how they are
        doing in other subjects. Also could suggest how long one should study for.<p>
      <h4 style="color:#00ff00">Advantages:</h4>
      <p>-Easy to model, can help students study effectively<br>-Can be easy to use</p>
      <h4 style="color:red">Disadvantages:</h4>
      <p>-It may already be obvious to the user what subjects they need to study for and how long.
      <br>-Could be difficult to calculate subjects like Maths which give extra points.</p>
      
      <h3 style="color:yellow"><u>3rd Idea: Identifying types of rocks</u> - Ross.N</h3>
      <p>Determines the type of a rock through its softness, its weight and what colour it is.
      <h4 style="color:#00ff00">Advantages:</h4>
      <p>-Relatively simple to code.<br>-Easy to use.<br>-Readable and easy to understand.</p>
      <h4 style="color:red">Disadvantages:</h4>
      <p>-Niche topic, majority of users would have no want for this program.
      <br>-Wide array of variables
      <br>-Experts on rocks would also have no need for the program.</p>
      
      <h2 style="color:yellow">What Did we pick?</h2>
      <p>For our ALT:3 Modelling and Simulation we decided to choose the 1st Idea, the model that solves mathematical
        problems. We decided to pick this idea as we believed it would be challenging, but also engaging to code. We
        also decided on this idea because it would assist a large number of users, as maths is something that everyone
        encounters in their daily life. This model will show what method was used to get the values to help people learn
        trigonometry.</p>

      <h2 style="color:yellow">Aims/Limitations</h2>
      <p>We aimed to create a computer program that would be able to see if any missing side or angle of any triangle
        could be found with the sides or angles given. Our model will ask multiple questions to determine what formula
        we should use to obtain the missing value the user is looking for. We programmed multiple different methods to
        find the missing value, such as the Pythagoras theorem, inverse sine inverse cosine, inverse tangent, sin, cos,
        tan, the cosine rule and finally the sine rule. Some limitations that we have is that it is not possible to
        calculate angles/sides if not enough information is given. Our program would also not be useful to those who are
        trying to find values relating to the area and perimetre of a triangle. </p>

      <h2 style="color:yellow">Ethical Issues</h2>
      <p>Some ethical issues of our project could be that it causes students to use our program to skip trigonometry
        homework. This could lead to them not learning trigonometry properly. Our program also may run into errors and
        not be completely accurate. This would be a major issue as if a user is using our program to create something
        physical, the structrual integrity may become compromised due to the flawed measurements.</p>

      <h2 style="color:yellow">Who will use our program?</h2>
      <p>Our Model could be utilised by people of all age ranges and occupations as maths is very common in our day to
        day activities. Our Model can help assist students to grasp the concept of Trigonometry, due to the fact that
        our program shows how values are calculated. Our Model can also help mathmeticians do trigonometry quickly. Our
        Model will help users calculate values for craft projects in metal work or wood work. It can finally help
        architects with designing rooms or making sure pieces of furniture will have enough space in said room. </p>

      <h2 style="color:yellow">Development Process</h2>
      <p>To make our program we used Python coding through an application called VScode. We started with making a
        Pseudocode on how our code will work then doing a flowchart to visualise how to code our program. We used a site
        called Lucidchart to create our flowchart.</p>

      <h3>Flowchart:</h3>
      <img src="Flowchart Alt3.png" alt="Flowchart" width="600" height="444">
      <p>We used this flowchart to help us throughout the coding process to see what we needed to complete. Our code was
        very complicated since there were many difficult things we had to code. Things such as transforming degrees to
        radians and using that value for multiple formulas, the formulas itself etc.</p>

      <h2 style="color:yellow">Reflection</h2>
      <p>Our model was overall a resounding success. The code worked brilliantly and there were very minor roadblocks
        throughout the coding process. The method of choosing whether we wanted to solve a side or an angle worked out
        much better than we expected and there was little overlap between the two programs. We were unfortunately unable
        to add the sine and cosine programs simply down to the lack of time in comparison to the scale of our model. The
        biggest challenge of our model was definetly getting started. It was very difficult to find out how to begin out
        coding and we werent sure whether to start the side code or the angle code first. The only unexpected question
        we were asking ourselves was how much more compact could we make our project? We wondered if we may have been
        able to use the same line of code for different steps in the process instead of just repeating individual lines
        of code. If we were to redo this model, we would make sure to finish the sine and cosine code and try to find
        clever solutions to allow us to create less code overall. </p>
