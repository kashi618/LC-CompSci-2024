      <h1>Applied Learning Task 4: Analytics</h1>

      <h2>Team members: Neil Jiang, David Knox </h2>
      <h3>Name of project: What is the most used gaming platform and title in 2022/2023? </h3>

      <p><b>Brief:</b>Hypothesising, making predictions, examining evidence, recognising patterns and reaching
        conclusions are at the heart of Computer Science. In this applied learning task, students will identify an
        interdisciplinary topic, develop a hypothesis and utilise existing resources to highlight the salient
        information and inform future decisions. By identifying, analysing, and deconstructing a problem, students will
        deepen their understanding of core practices and principles of Computer Science.

      <ol>
        <b>Design Process</b>
        <li><b>Investigate</b></li>
        <p> Brainstorm potential ideas for ALT4. Make a note of the ideas here in the report and briefly detail the
          reasons to include and exclude the ideas. Define what the problem is.

        </p>

        <li><b>Plan</b> </li>
        <p> Understand what the problem is.
          Describe the role of each member of the team.
          Include a sketch of the project, you can include flow charts.

        </p>

        <li><b>Design</b> </li>
        <p>Create a representation decide what equipmentor sensors you need.
        </p>

        <li><b>Create</b> </li>
        <p> Implement the plan. Include a video and a photo of the embedded system along with a photo of the code used
          in the project. These can be placed below. </p>



        <li><b>Evaluate</b> </li>
        <p>
          Determine if the solution is appropriate
          </b>


          <li><b>Document</b> </li>
        <p>
          What worked/ didnâ€™t work.
          How could you improve if you were to do this again?
          What did you learn doing this project?
          Put in links to individual reflection
        </p>
